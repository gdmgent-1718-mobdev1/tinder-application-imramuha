The tinder app
===================

So far I can: get a random  visualized persons profile.
Nay it -> and go to next profile. Yay it -> and save it into localstorage. 
Also be able to get the items from localstorage (all my yays) and show them visually.



> **TO DO:**

> - make sure I don't see a random person twice.
> - create a user profile.
> - sleep
> - css with variables.
